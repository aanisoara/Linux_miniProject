  summary: library for editing command lines as they are typed in
  description: |
    The GNU Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications 
    that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. 
    The Readline library includes additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command lines, 
    to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands.
